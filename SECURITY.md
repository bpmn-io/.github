# Security

Camunda takes security bugs in the our software products seriously. This covers source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, including [Camunda](https://github.com/camunda) and [bpmn.io](https://github.com/bpmn-io). 

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the [Camunda Modeler](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler) or a [bpmn.io library](https://github.com/bpmn-io), please report it to us [as described below](#reporting-security-issues). Head over to the [Camunda security page](https://docs.camunda.org/security/report-vulnerability/) to report vulnerabilities in other Camunda products.

__Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.__


## Reporting Security Issues

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [modeling@camunda.com](mailto:modeling@camunda.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The development team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
